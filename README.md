# Redux Voting Server

This project works with [redux-voting-client, which can be found here](https://github.com/marcacyr/redux-voting-client).

See that project for more info about this project. Many of the dependencies are the same (with only slight differences) and
the two work hand-in-hand and are both required to run the application in its entirety.
